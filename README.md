remember-brightness
===================

Simple utility to add screen brightness persistence in Linux.

Tested on a Lenovo Yoga 13 running Elementary OS, which is based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but maybe it could work in other configurations.

This program must be run as root, in order to be able to modify /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
